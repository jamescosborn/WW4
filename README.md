# WORLD WAR 4
##### by Adam Titus and James Osborn

### Description

_I do not know with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones._

--Albert Einstein  

At the dusk of the 21st century, humanity nearly destroyed itself in thermonuclear war. A nuclear winter swept the earth for over 20 years, and from the ashes arose a new people and a new age.  Man and beast melded into Centaurs, and a new struggle for power consumed the world.

In WW4 the player will experience:


* A random name generator at character creation  
* 3 playable classes with unique special abilities:
  __Gladiator__, __Hunter__, __Warlock__
* 7 unique enemies
* 5 unique bosses
